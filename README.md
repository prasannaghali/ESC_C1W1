Project: Course 1 Week 1 Assignment
Description: The file stats.h now contains all the required function
declarations. Stubbed definitions of these functions have been added to
stats.c The driver function main() has been altered to call the defined
functions. The original main() has been altered to match ANSI C specs.
The project compiles, links and can be executed (without the correct output).
